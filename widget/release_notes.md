## What's New

- In *Edit View* of the SOC Overview Sankey Chart has been completely revamped to add a **Data Source** field using which users can choose whether to render static or live data:
    - **Record Containing JSON Data** - To render all records in a single keystore record that contains a JSON object. 
    - **Get Live Data** - To dynamically render nodes and links data. The live data is queried based on the selected module and fields.
- Added internationalization support.
